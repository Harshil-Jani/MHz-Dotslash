**Project**: Youtube videos note taking extension.

**Problem Statement**: In today's world, most of the students are dependant on youtube videos for their study and research work. They need a platform through which they can easily take notes and capture important screenshots from the ongoing video, and organise them in one place for future reference.

**Solution**: We have built a note taking chrome extension that provides the following features:
 1. Capture Screenshot of video and directly add it to notes with one click. This way students will no longer have to take a long road of taking screenshots, saving them in some folder, and then later on add to note/ doc applications. Just click on the screenshot button, and violla.
 2. Add ordered/ unordered list and checkbox. List making is the most common way people use to  make notes quickly and in an organised way. Hence apart from adding simple text, we have also provided some additional functionalitites of adding bulletin points, numbered list and checkboxes for the same.
 3. Speech to text converter. Feel lazy to type? Speak and add your notes.
 4. Organised Folders to save our notes. Students can create organised folders in our extension and save their notes in it. They can also save the pdf of the notes on their computer system if they wish to.

**Future goals and planning**: In order to make online study smoother, in future we want to extend our chrome extension to blogsites as well, where students can highlight the important points, mark the doubtful points, add additional notes/ annotations on the website, and save the changes in our organised folder or download the pdf, just as they would do on any physical textbook.
